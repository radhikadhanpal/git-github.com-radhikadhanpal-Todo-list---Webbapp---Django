# Overview

## Todo List

I've created a web app using Django Python. It was a great learning experience to work with Django and understand how it functions. I'm excited about creating more web apps using this technology.

To view the web app on your computer, you will need to start a test server. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:


``` python manage.py runserver ```

Once the server is up and running, you can access the first page of the app by opening your web browser and going to http://127.0.0.1:8000/ and http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/. This will take you to the admin page of the web app. From there, you can navigate to different parts of the app and see its functionality.

The purpose for writing this software was to create a web application using Django Python. I was interested in learning how to use Django and explore its functionality. Additionally, I wanted to gain more experience in creating web apps in general, so this project was a great opportunity for me to do that.

Ultimately, my goal was to create a functional web app that could be used for various purposes, and to improve my skills as a developer in the process.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running (starting the server and navigating through the web pages) and a walkthrough of the code.}
