# Overview

## Todo List

I've created a web app using Django Python. It was a great learning experience to work with Django and understand how it functions. I'm excited about creating more web apps using this technology.

To view the web app on your computer, you will need to start a test server. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:


``` python manage.py runserver ```

Once the server is up and running, you can access the first page of the app by opening your web browser and going to http://127.0.0.1:8000/ and http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/. This will take you to the admin page of the web app. From there, you can navigate to different parts of the app and see its functionality.

The purpose for writing this software was to create a web application using Django Python. I was interested in learning how to use Django and explore its functionality. Additionally, I wanted to gain more experience in creating web apps in general, so this project was a great opportunity for me to do that.

Ultimately, my goal was to create a functional web app that could be used for various purposes, and to improve my skills as a developer in the process.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running (starting the server and navigating through the web pages) and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Web Pages

I created two web pages for the web app. The first page, which can be accessed by going to "http://127.0.0.1:8000/", is the main page of the app. It displays a list of tasks that need to be done. This list is dynamic, meaning it can change based on the tasks that are added or completed. Users can add new tasks or mark existing ones as complete.

The second page, which can be accessed by going to "http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/", is the administrative page of the app. It allows the app administrator to manage the tasks and users of the app. This page is also dynamic, meaning the administrator can add, edit, or delete tasks and users as needed.

To transition between the two pages, users can click on links or buttons on the page that take them to the other page. For example, from the main page, users can click on a link that takes them to the administrative page by going to "http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/". Similarly, from the administrative page, users can click on a link that takes them back to the main page by going to "http://127.0.0.1:8000/".

# Development Environment

Git, Visual Studio Code, Django, Heroku, Python.

The programming language used to develop the software is Python, with the Django web framework. In addition, Git was used for version control, Visual Studio Code was used as the integrated development environment (IDE), and Heroku was used as the deployment platform. Various Python libraries were used throughout the development process, including Pillow for image handling, and psycopg2 for database connectivity with PostgreSQL.

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}
* I will be making more web apges and personalising it.
* I will be adding links to sites for help (example: workout, groceries etc).
* I will be deploying it on Heroku.
